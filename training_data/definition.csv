Uniformed search,"Uniformed search does not have any prior knowledge about how close a state is to the goal. It is useful when the problem domain lacks additional information or heuristics to guide the search process. However, it can be inefficient in complex search spaces since it does not exploit any domain-specific knowledge to guide the search direction."
Breadth-first search,"BFS expands the shallowest node."
Depth-first search,"DFS expands the deepest node."

Heuristics,"A function that estimates how close a state is to a goal. It is designed for a particular search problem."
Greedy Best-First Search,"Also called Pure heuristic search, it expands the node that seems closest according to a heuristic, an estimate of distance to the nearest goal for each state."
A* Search,"It combines uniform cost search and greedy search."
Admissible,"A heuristic is admissible if it is optimistic, meaning 0 <= h(n) <= h*(n), where h(n) is the heuristic estimate and h*(n) is the true cost to reach the goal from n."
Syntax,"The arrangement of symbols into legal sentences or well-formed formulas."
Semantics,"The meaning of symbols in the world, mapping between symbols and worlds."
Knowledgebase,"A knowledgebase contains a set of propositional logic formulae that are known to be true, the premises."
